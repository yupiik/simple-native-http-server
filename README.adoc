= Simple HTTP Server

Intended to provide a light docker image embedding a tomcat serving a folder.

== Configuration

Configuration is done through image parameters.
First one is the port (default to `8080`) and second one is the docbase (where static website is located - default to `/opt/yupiik/www`).

Port can be overridden with `PORT` environment variable and doc base with `DOC_BASE` one.
