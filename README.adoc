= Simple HTTP Server

Intended to provide a light docker image embedding a tomcat serving a folder.

== Configuration

Configuration is done through image parameters.
First one is the port (default to `8080`) and second one is the docbase (where static website is located - default to `/opt/yupiik/www`).

Port can be overridden with `PORT` environment variable and doc base with `DOC_BASE` one.

== Sample usages

=== Docker

[source,bash]
----
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 -v /my/www:/my/www  ossyupiik/simple-http-server 8080 /my/www
----

Then hit http://localhost:8080.

TIP: depending your docker version you can need to set `--security-opt seccomp=unconfined` option.
